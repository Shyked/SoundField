# Purpose of Sounfield

The goal of this project is to build a modulable game to associate a spatial
representation of a place, along with a spatial positionning of various sounds,
all of this available in a browser.

One can walk freely in this space, and record an export of their experience.

It was also for me an opportunity to experiment with:
- The Web Audio API, using mostly panning, gain and convolution
- Isometric projection, taken and improved from

# Demo

## First experiment

A first experiment, where I placed the audio sources in a 2D space seen from
above. The first audio source on the top is sending a music with vocals. The
other sources are instrumentals.

Click anywhere on the page to start the experiment, the use WASD / ZQSD keys to
move on the space.

## Current state of the project

Demo runnig the current code in this repository. Click anywhere on the page to
start, the use WASD / ZQSD keys to move. The black and white circles on the map
